It calculates the logarithm of the product of the predicted probability and the actual probability raised to the power of the actual probability, summed over all events. This gives us a measure of how well the model predicts the outcomes.  \n",

It measures how well a model's predicted probabilities match the true probabilities of the underlying data. The formula for cross-entropy is -E\\_x \\sim P [log(q(x))], where P is the true distribution and q(x) is the estimated distribution. This can also be expressed as the sum of the entropy of the true distribution and the KL divergence between the true and estimated distributions. Cross-entropy can be implemented in various programming languages such as Python, MXNet, and TensorFlow.  \n",
