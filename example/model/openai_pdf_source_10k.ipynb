Historically, revenues in the first and fourth \\nfiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters.  However, the mix of product sales may vary \\nconsiderably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear , apparel and equipment, \\nas well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as \\nwell as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer \\npreferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing \\nsports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A.

We believe that it is important to attract, develop and retain a diverse and engaged workforce at all levels of our \\nbusiness and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation. W e are focused on building an increasingly \\ndiverse talent pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve.\\nCULTURE \\nEach employee shapes NIKE's culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core \\nvalues and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor , inform and guide us and apply \\nto all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if \\nyou have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more \\nsustainably, building a creative and diverse global team, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact \\nin communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep commitment to maintaining an environment where \\nall NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace \\nculture. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated \\nto giving access to training programs and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIK E's values, history and \\nbusiness, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and qualified tuition \\nreimbursement opportunities. \\nAs part of our commitment to empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through our \\nEngagement Survey program, including several corporate pulse surveys. The program provides every employee throughout the \\nglobe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their \\nsatisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally . The program also measures our employees’ emotional \\ncommitment to NIKE as well as NIKE's culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for \\nemployees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace \\npolicies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy .\\nAs part of our commitment to make a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal \\nyear's pre-tax income into global communities. The focus of this investment continues to be inspiring kids to be active through \\nplay and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities to create a better and more equitable future for all. Our community \\ninvestments are an important part of our culture in that we also support employees in giving back to community organizations \\nthrough donations and volunteering, which are matched by the NIK E Foundation where eligible.\\nEMPLOYEE BASE\\nAs of May 31, 2023, we had approximately 83,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees.

We believe that it is important to attract, develop and retain a diverse and engaged workforce at all levels of our business and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation. W e are focused on building an increasingly diverse talent pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve.\\nCULTURE \\nEach employee shapes NIKE's culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core values and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor , inform and guide us and apply to all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more sustainably, building a creative and diverse global team, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact in communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep commitment to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace culture. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated to giving access to training programs and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIK E's values, history and business, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and qualified tuition reimbursement opportunities. \\nAs part of our commitment to empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through our Engagement Survey program, including several corporate pulse surveys. The program provides every employee throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their satisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally . The program also measures our employees’ emotional commitment to NIKE as well as NIKE's culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for employees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace policies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy .\\nAs part of our commitment to make a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal year's pre-tax income into global communities. The focus of this investment continues to be inspiring kids to be active through play and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities to create a better and more equitable future for all. Our community investments are an important part of our culture in that we also support employees in giving back to community organizations through donations and volunteering, which are matched by the NIK E Foundation where eligible.\\nEMPLOYEE BASE\\nAs of May 31, 2023, we had approximately 83,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees.

W e are actively monitoring actions that may result in \\nadditional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other \\nimpediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear , apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for \\ntrade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and \\nresponses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by \\nother countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with \\nbusiness operations and/or consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way \\nwe conduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. \\nIn addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade \\nassociations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses \\nlegitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies \\nand the important role they may play in the global economic community .\\nWhere trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate \\nalternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products \\nfrom our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse \\nfinancial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, \\ntherefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-ef fective and could have an \\nongoing adverse impact on profitability.\\nNIKE, INC. 4   \n",

       "7                                             HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\\nAt NIKE, we consider the strength and effective management of our workforce to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that it is important to attract, develop and retain a diverse and engaged workforce at all levels of our business and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation. W e are focused on building an increasingly diverse talent pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve.\\nCULTURE \\nEach employee shapes NIKE's culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core values and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor , inform and guide us and apply to all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more sustainably, building a creative and diverse global team, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact in communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep commitment to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace culture. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated to giving access to training programs and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIK E's values, history and business, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and qualified tuition reimbursement opportunities. \\nAs part of our commitment to empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through our Engagement Survey program, including several corporate pulse surveys. The program provides every employee throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their satisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally . The program also measures our employees’ emotional commitment to NIKE as well as NIKE's culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for employees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace policies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy .\\nAs part of our commitment to make a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal year's pre-tax income into global communities. The focus of this investment continues to be inspiring kids to be active through play and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities to create a better and more equitable future for all. Our community investments are an important part of our culture in that we also support employees in giving back to community organizations through donations and volunteering, which are matched by the NIK E Foundation where eligible.\\nEMPLOYEE BASE\\nAs of May 31, 2023, we had approximately 83,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce.\\nNone of our employees are represented by a union, except certain employees in the E MEA and APLA geographies are members of and/or represented by trade unions, as allowed or required by local law and/or collective bargaining agreements. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain subsidiary decisions) or by organizations similar to a union.
