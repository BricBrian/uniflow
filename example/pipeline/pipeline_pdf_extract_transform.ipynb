       "We collected marathon performance data from a systematic sample of elite and sub-elite athletes over the period 2015 to 2019, then searched the internet for publicly-available photographs of these performances, identifying whether the Nike Vaporly shoes were worn or not in each performance. Controlling for athlete ability and race difficulty, we estimated the effect on marathon times of wearing the Vaporfly shoes. Assuming that the effect of Vaporfly shoes is additive, we estimate that the Vaporfly shoes improve men's times between 2.0 and 3.9 minutes, while they improve women's times between 0.8 and 3.5 minutes. Assuming that the effect of Vaporfly shoes is multiplicative, we estimate that they improve men's times between 1.4 and 2.8 percent and women's performances between 0.6 and 2.2 percent. The improvements are in comparison to the shoe the athlete was wearing before switching to Vaporfly shoes, and represents an expected improvement rather than a guaranteed improvement.</td>\n",

       "There is a growing consensus that Nike Corporation's new line of marathon racing shoes, which are commonly referred to as Vaporflys, provide a significant performance advantage to athletes who wear them. While several different versions of the shoes have appeared in races, including the Vaporfly 4%, the Vaporfly Next%, the Alphafly, and several prototype shoes, each iteration of the shoes has in common a carbon fiber plate stacked inside of a highly responsive foam sole.\n",
       "Several research studies have investigated the magnitude of the Vaporfly performance benefit. Hoogkamer et al. (2018) and Barnes and Kilding (2019) tested highly trained distance runners in laboratory studies, measuring various biomechanical and physiological variables while subjects wore Vaporflys and several other shoes in trial runs on a treadmill. Although the measured benefits varied somewhat from athlete to athlete, both studies found a roughly 4% average reduction in energy expenditures while wearing Vaporflys, in comparison to other popular racing shoes such as the Adidas Adizero Adios Boost line of racing shoes, and Nike Zoom Matumbo track spikes.\n",
       "The Upshot, a division of The New York Times, collected data from actual marathon performances recorded on Strava, a popular running log and GPS tracking website. Their study included hundreds of thousands of marathon performances, and dozens of different shoes. The Upshot found that the Vaporflys imparted a 4 to 5% advantage in finishing time over anaverage shoe and a 1.5 to 2.5% advantage over the second-best shoe (Kealy and Katz, 2018, 2019). A study published by Wired Magazine found that a sample of runners in the 2017 New York City Marathon were more likely to run the second half of the race faster than the first if they were wearing Vaporflys (Thompson, 2017).\n",
       "Our study is most similar to the Upshot study in that we analyze data from marathon performances and compare people's performances with and without the Vaporflys. However, our study differs in a few ways. First, instead of relying on a convenient sample of athletes who upload their data to Strava, we take an exhaustive sample of athletes who met a minimum performance standard at one of 22 of the largest marathon venues in 2015 and 2016 in the US and Canada. Second, instead of relying on self-reported shoe data, we searched the internet for photos of races and visually identified the shoes that runners wore. Third, we focus only on athletes who performed at an elite level before the Vaporflys were released to the public. Thus, we are only considering accomplished runners with marathon experience who, most likely, settled on a suitable shoe before the Vaporflys were released. These runners are also those most likely to be affected by shoe regulations because many of them compete in national Olympic qualifying races subject to regulations.</td>\n",

We assumed that Vaporfly shoes were not worn in 2015 or 2016 by any runners except for a few that were reported to have worn prototypes in the 2016 US Olympic Trials Marathon. Identification of shoes via photos is a manual process that is subject to error. We have made all of our shoe identifications publicly available at [https://github.com/joeguinness/vaporfly](https://github.com/joeguinness/vaporfly) and will update this paper with new data if we are made aware of any errors in shoe identification.

Aside from a few prototypes being used in 2016, adoption of the shoes began in early 2017 and rose to over 50% on average in races at the end of 2019. The right plot contains the average marathon time for each athlete in the dataset in Vaporfly vs. non-Vaporfly shoes. Most runners' average time in Vaporfly shoes is faster than their average time in non-Vaporfly shoes.

This is achieved by fitting a statistical model with non-random effects for Vaporfly shoes and random effects for runner ability, overall course difficulty, and course difficulty specific to year.

We assign each performance a label between \\(1\\) and \\(n\\) (\\(n=840\\) for men, \\(n=778\\) for women).

The model assumes that, all else held constant, switching to Vaporfly shoes changes the response by \\(b_{1}\\). We do not attempt to model Vaporfly effects that vary among individual runners. The interpretations of the parameters are different depending on whether we take a log transformation of the times or not. When modeling untransformed times, the effect of Vaporfly shoes is additive, meaning that we expect the time to change by adding \\(b_{1}\\), and when modeling log-transformed times, the effect is multiplicative, meaning that we expect the time to change by multiplying by \\(\\exp(b_{1})\\).\n",

We also considered including time-varying runner effects, to allow each runner's fitness to improve or decline over time independently of the fitness of other runners, but we decided that this model placed too much weight on athletes who raced frequently.

       "By collecting data on marathon times and identifying shoes worn in a systematic sample of elite and sub-elite marathon runners, we studied how much a runner's marathon time can be expected to improve after switching to Vaporfly shoes. For men, the improvement is most likely somewhere between 2.0 and 3.9 minutes, or between 1.4% and 2.8%. For women it is likely between 0.8 and 3.5 minutes, or between 0.6% and 2.2%. To put these numbers into perspective, elite marathon runners cover more than half a mile in 3 minutes.\n",
       "We made several assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but nevertheless are open for debate and could be refined. We assumed that the expected Vaporfly effect (\\(b_{1}\\)) is the same for every runner of the same sex. Including prototypes, there are several different versions of Vaporflys, and it is logical to expect that newer versions improve upon older versions. Moreover, depending on biomechanical factors, some runners may benefit from Vaporflys more than others, or could have been wearing shoes that were not optimal for them before switching to Vaporflys. The models assume that, conditional on the runner and race, the marathon time follows a normal distribution. This may not be entirely appropriate because we believe that a runner is more likely to run 5 minutes slower than expected rather than 5 minutes faster; when things go wrong in a marathon, they can go really wrong.\n",
       "The study did not include data on runners that did not finish their races. This data is more difficult to obtain and more difficult to model. Based on the Wired study (Thompson, 2017), which found that people wearing Vaporflys generally ran better in the second half of the race, we believe that people wearing Vaporflys are less likely to drop out, so we are more likely to miss the very worst performances in non-Vaporfly shoes. Thus, we believe that including drop-outs would only strengthen our estimate of the Vaporfly effect.\n",
       "The shoes were identified via a manual process of searching through photographs. We believe that this manual process for getting the shoe data is better (though labor intensive) than relying on self-reported shoes. Nonetheless, it is prone to error in misidentification of the person and the shoes. For example, Nike has an orange Vaporfly with a black Swoosh logo, and also a Zoom Fly with the same color scheme. Another example, some professional athletes ran in a neon yellow and pink prototype Vaporfly, which looks very similar to the neon yellow and pink Nike Zoom Streak 6. See Johnson (2020) for a more detailed analysis. Yet a further example, we identified one athlete who attempted to conceal the identity of his shoes by coloring in the white Swoosh on a blue pair of Vaporflys.\n",
       "Some of the athletes may have competed in marathons not included in the 22 marathons that we sampled. Missing these performances shouldn't bias our results, but our results could be strengthened if we are able to track down every performance from the athletes in the study.\n",
       "It is possible that athletes are more likely to switch to Vaporfly shoes when they know they are ready to turn in a good marathon performance. Inversely, some athletes might not be willing to pay $250 for shoes when they are out of shape. The Upshot study investigated this possibility by controlling for training volume; they did not see substantially different results. Further, our sample consists of solely highly accomplished runners. We believe that these athletes are generally wearing the best shoes available to them whenever they run a marathon.\n",
       "We were able to identify shoes in nearly all, but not all marathon performances. Athletes have the ability to suppress photographs of themselves, for example by untagging themselves in Facebook photos, or simply electing not to post pictures of themselves from their races. If athletes are more likely to suppress photos of poor performances in Vaporfly shoes, our estimated effect of Vaporfly shoes could be larger than it should be.\n",
